# PcMediaVault

PcMediaVault is a python remake of the MediaVault application which is an open source desktop application, for AmigaOS 4, which can be
used to discover online radio stations.

The application uses Python with PySimpleGui and the Radio api to fetch radio channels and make them playable into a vlc client.
